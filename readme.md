# Meteor, the perfect backend to React

## Overview

This is an example application that shows a React application with Meteor as the backend system.

This was part of a talk for the Sydney Node.js meetup.

The slides for the talk are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DLWHZukq6QZV1iF8cgcFy8wuFe3JfOFAMiK02hQZXok/edit?usp=sharing)

## Install

Make you have Meteor installed first:

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```
Then in the `todos` folder run meteor:

```
meteor
```

Meteor will install all the dependencies and run a local instance of MongoDB

The website will be running at http://localhost:3000

## React + Meteor

The latest git check in has meteor hooked up to the React app, but if you want to see it with React only, revert to the first check in.
